# Assignment

## Problem Statement

1. Pull the code from gitlab.com/aruvi4/gap-sad
2. Ensure that it works. If it doesn't work, get things clarified *before Tuesday ends*
3. Add an on-screen keyboard component to it *a la* https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
4. Make the UI pretty (find out how) and responsive (find out how).

## An extra note

Be careful about submitting code that is too similar to a classmate. A good way to do this is to talk about what you're going to do with others but never asking for their actual code. That kind of "inspiration" is hard to shake off.

## Points

The assignment is worth the remaining 20 points in the Rich Frameworks module. Chaitanya's word is final on whether the UX is acceptable.

## Deadline

10am Thursday May 15 2025.
