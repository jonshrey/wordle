In high school, you may have gotten used to writing polynomials like this:

$-25x^15+13x^3+2x^2-x-5$

However, at a higher ed level, mathematicians prefer to write it as

$-5-x^0+2x^2+13x^3-25x^15$

Write a class that can be initialized through an input written in the first format and whose objects can be printed in the second format.
